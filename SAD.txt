# Social Anxiety Disorder: what it is, how it shows up, and what helps

**Social anxiety disorder (SAD)**—also called **social phobia**—is a treatable anxiety condition marked by **intense fear of social or performance situations** where you might be **judged**, **embarrassed**, or **rejected**. The fear is persistent (6+ months), causes **avoidance** or white-knuckle endurance, and **gets in the way** of school, work, or relationships.

## How it feels (common signs)

* **Before**: rumination (“What if I blank out?”), dread, poor sleep, planning escape routes.
* **During**: racing heart, blushing, shaking, sweating, dry mouth, mind going blank; strong urge to flee.
* **After**: replaying (“I sounded stupid”), harsh self-criticism, shame.
* **Situations**: conversations, eating/drinking in public, meetings/class, using the phone, dating, giving presentations.
  *Performance-only* subtype = fear limited to public speaking/performing.

**Not just shyness:** the key differences are **distress**, **impairment**, and **avoidance**.

## Why it persists (the CBT view)

* **Threat beliefs**: “If they notice my anxiety, they’ll think I’m incompetent.”
* **Self-focus**: attention turns inward to symptoms + imagined appearance (“I must be beet red”).
* **Safety behaviors** that backfire: over-preparing, memorizing lines, avoiding eye contact, speaking softly, rehearsing, hiding blushing with clothes/makeup, camera-off, alcohol “take the edge off.” These prevent learning that the feared outcome usually **doesn’t** happen—or isn’t catastrophic.
* **Post-event rumination** strengthens the fear memory.

## Evidence-based treatments

**Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (first-line)**

* **Psychoeducation** about the anxiety cycle.
* **Attention training**: shifting from self-focus to the task/other person.
* **Cognitive restructuring**: test predictions vs. real outcomes.
* **Video/feedback experiments**: compare feared appearance to actual.
* **Graduated exposure** to avoided situations **without** safety behaviors (e.g., ask a stranger for directions, speak up once per meeting, eat in a café, give brief talks). Repetition builds tolerance and disconfirms fears.

**Medications**

* **SSRIs/SNRIs** reduce baseline social anxiety; often combined with CBT.
* **Beta-blockers** (e.g., propranolol) can help **performance-only** physical symptoms (tremor, pounding heart) when taken **as needed** before a speech; they don’t treat generalized SAD.
* **Benzodiazepines** are generally **not first-line** due to dependence and interference with exposure learning.

**Skills & lifestyle**

* Regular **sleep**, **exercise**, and **caffeine/alcohol moderation** (both can worsen symptoms).
* **Compassionate self-talk** and values-based goals to counter perfectionism.
* **Social skills practice** when relevant (e.g., starting/ending conversations).

## In-the-moment plan for a feared situation

1. **Name it:** “This is social anxiety, not danger.”
2. **Drop safety behaviors:** speak at normal volume, maintain natural eye contact, no over-apologies.
3. **Task focus:** get curious about the other person (what they’re saying, 3 details in the room).
4. **Allow symptoms:** let blush/tremor be there; aim for *connection*, not *performance*.
5. **Debrief like a scientist:** “What did I predict? What actually happened? What does that say about my belief?”

## When to seek help

* You’re avoiding important activities (classes, meetings, dating, networking), or the effort to endure them is exhausting.
* Symptoms persist **6+ months** and impair work/school/relationships.
* You’re using alcohol/drugs to cope.

A therapist trained in **CBT for social anxiety** (often 10–16 sessions, group or individual) has excellent outcomes. Many people regain social confidence and reduce avoidance markedly.
